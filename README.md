Hi, I'm Vazgen 👋
🚀 Student | Developer | Innovator
I'm a student at Penn High School with a passion for robotics, AI, and software development. I love building innovative projects and exploring new technologies to solve real-world problems.

🔭 I’m currently working on PennAI, an AI-powered chatbot for my high school.
💡 My interests include AI, web development, and competitive robotics.
🏆 Former FIRST Robotics team member, where I honed my skills in programming and teamwork.
⚡ Fun fact: I rediscovered my love for tennis after a break and made the school team on my second try!
